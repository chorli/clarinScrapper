# clarinScrapper
Simple sample of web scrapping using Python

Welcome to ClarinScrapper project

For this project you will need:

1. Python interpreter (v3 up) -- https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Libraries for web scrapping:
  - pandas
  - request
  - beautifulSoup
3. DbBrowser for SQLite --- https://sqlitebrowser.org/
3. Some editor of you choice -- I prefer Visua Studio code ;)
4. Time and fun!


Ok, to start working you can either download the project via zip file or use git.
You are free to contribute.

Once you download the project, please follow this stepss:

1. Open your text editor
2. Go to constants and edit this one: CONST_SITE_DB_FILE
3. Here you will put the DB name you'll create in your DBBrowser for SqLite (you can put the same as the one in the project)
4. Go to DbBroser for SqLite and create the Db.
5. Run you python clarinScrapper.py file, either manually or within your editor.

Once you run the program you'll see the DB tables will begin to populate. It's your decision how you use the data from that moment on ;)
